# Movie-Recommendation-System
Recommendation systems are the systems that are used to gain more user attraction by understanding the user’s taste. These systems have now become popular because of their ability to provide personalized content to users that are of the user’s interest. These days millions of products are listed on e-commerce websites that make it impossible to find out a product of our desired choice. This is where these systems help us by quickly recommending us with the desired products. Also, Netflix suggests the same genre movies to us by understanding our interest/ choice of movies we like similarly Youtube recommends videos to us. There are many different recommendation engines that work backends to make it possible.
